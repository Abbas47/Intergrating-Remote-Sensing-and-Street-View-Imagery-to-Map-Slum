# Intergrating-Remote-Sensing-and-Street-View-Imagery-to-Map-Slum
This repositry is dedicated to my MSc. theis in which i have intergarte the remote sensing imagery and street view imagery to map slums using deep learning approach.
The aim of the research is to map the slums in the dense urban environment using FCN-DK deep learning architure. In this research we have intergated overhead infromation with ground level information to understand the urban context of the study area (Jakarta), i.e., intergarte the remote sensing imagery and street view imagery.
We have selected the jakarta as our study area beacuse around 60% of Jakarta population lives in informal settlemnts called as Kampungs.
